Revision history for Perl extension Lingua::PT::Speaker.

0.07  Tue Aug 17 15:00:00 2005
	- Changed to Module::Install instead of MakeMaker, so I can
	  autobundle Config::AutoConf, needed during configuration.

0.06  Sat Aug 13 13:40:00 2005
	- Trying to fix CPAN indexation, and add a description to the
          module.

0.05  Fri Aug 12 19:30:00 2005
	- Dependency on Config::AutoConf. Now we check automatically
          for a number of different places where the phonemes library
          could be, as well for a different number of possible wav
          players.
	- Hopefully this module starts to be prepared for CPAN;
	- Added dependency on Text::RewriteRules instead of using mktextrr
	- Rearranged directory structure.

0.04  ...
	- added mktextrr to the distribution as it is required.
