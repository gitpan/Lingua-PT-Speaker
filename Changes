	- Trying to fix CPAN indexation, and add a description to the
          module.

0.05  Fri Aug 12 19:30:00 2005
	- Dependency on Config::AutoConf. Now we check automatically
          for a number of different places where the phonemes library
          could be, as well for a different number of possible wav
          players.
	- Hopefully this module starts to be prepared for CPAN;
	- Added dependency on Text::RewriteRules instead of using mktextrr
	- Rearranged directory structure.

	- added mktextrr to the distribution as it is required.
